  <p>Hi, I'm Mayank, a product builder with a bias for curiosity, personal growth, and getting things done.</p>
  <p>I didn't start in product, but found my way here through a few messy iterations of figuring out what really brings me joy. Over the years, I've built products across B2C marketplaces and B2B SaaS, with a focus on food deliver and developer tools.</p>

  <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1.5px solid #eee; margin: 2.5rem 0;">

  <p>This space is where I reflect, write, and share ideas that don't fit into a deck or a roadmap.</p>
