  <p>Hi, I'm Mayank, a product builder with a bias for curiosity, personal growth, and getting things done.</p>
  <p>I didn't start in product, but found my way here through a few messy iterations of figuring out what really brings me joy. Over the years, I've built products across B2C marketplaces and B2B SaaS, with a focus on food deliver and developer tools.</p>

  <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1.5px solid #eee; margin: 2.5rem 0;">

  <p>This space is where I reflect, write, and share ideas that don't fit into a deck or a roadmap.</p>

# Product Demo

**Order Management 2.0 at Gojek:** I led the conceptualisation, build and launch to revamp the entire order management workflow for SouthEast Asia's biggest food delivery platform GoFood as part of Gojek. This product involved changes across multiple flows and across all 3 sides of the marketplace each with their own mobile apps: customer, driver and merchants.
