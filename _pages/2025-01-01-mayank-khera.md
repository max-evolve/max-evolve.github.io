# Mayank Khera

### Hi 👋 I'm Mayank

I like to build things, solve problems, and box 🥊

My left-brained personality often finds interest in storytelling through data and tearing down products to unearth some exciting insights. I am also passionate about cliched stuff like 🍕 food (not just eating but cooking 👨🏻‍🍳 ) and exploring places less travelled.
