# Pointers for resume

- On average recruiters spend 10 seconds to skim through your resume. It should be 1 page with 1 line objective
- Simple and clear points. No more than 3-4 bullet points per role
- **Bring out the experiences that matter for the role** - for eg. if data skills are necessary for the role, talk about your experiences related to the skills that matter
- Target and customise your resume for companies that you really want to prioritise
- Focus on 3 things when talking about your role:
    - **Responsibility**: Led the post order experience vertical
    - **Scale**: impacting 1.5M+ daily customers
    - **Impact**: uplifting the booking completion rates from 80% to 92%
- [Here](https://www.notion.so/409a40e72b4d445f94b17b69af80a94e?pvs=21) are some basic hygiene pointers to consider.

**Other considerations:**

- Prioritize the most important information and make it easy for the reader/recruiter/hiring manager to find. This is a reflection of your ability to figure out what's most important and explain it clearly.
- Provide a clear and concise 15-second takeaway at the top of the resume, calling out your skills or most relevant experience at the top to ensure they are noticed. You can customize this for different roles.
- Avoid using internal jargon or project names that may confuse those outside the organization. Describe the desired customer impact in simple language as much as possible unless you're confident your audience will understand the jargon.
- Clearly state the impact and results of your work first rather than focusing on listing job responsibilities.
- Use white space to make the resume more visually appealing and easier to read. Your resume is a reflection of your design and user experience sense. I'd aim for at least one empty line between each experience and a larger space between sections.

**Referrals vs Apply through website:**

- Connect with people genuinely to get referrals and be upfront about it. Referrals are usually the best way to get your foot in the door, but not the only way. I have seen people apply through the website, get a call and convert and join the company.
- Dropping cold messages on linkedin needs to be done in the right manner. Time cap on hearing back from your network (usually 4-5 working days), else apply through the website. Remember that the openings also tend to dry up and they won't stay for long, So, you need to act fast. I have personally had 2 instances where I entered the interview funnel quite late, which meant someone was already offered the job while I was at interview#2 out of 5. In this case, either the company will offer you another opportunity or put you on hold and inform you that the position has been taken up. In my case, it sucked that I was put on hold both times.
