# Long term discipline over short-term intensity

Date: 14 September 2022

→ **Take full responsible for everything in your life** 

**→ Disciplined and consistency is holding you back**

1. Focus on one thing - Focus 100% on one thing instead of 5 things with 20% focus. 
2. Make gradual improvements - You can't go to level 10 with level 1 habits. Minor improvements over time lead to BIG changes. Example: start by reading 1 page, start by writing one paragraph. 
3. Stay consistent and meet deadlines
4. Find an accountability partner

→ **Be in the top-25% for 2 or 3 max things**

Scott Adams (creator of Dilbert): "In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I'm hardly an artist. And I'm not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I'm funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It's the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it."

→ **Genius is being extremely good at a couple of things that really matter.**

The first requirement to do genius-level work is to not be afraid to do things only geniuses can do, i.e. to have the internal feeling of being better than everyone else in the world. The concept of intelligence kills this feeling. However smart you are, there is someone who is smarter than you. You don't need to be the smartest person in the world. 

**→ Find your purpose**

Its hard to live a fulfilled life without direction or a clear plan. Everything in life becomes easier once you find your purpose and get clarity on what's next.
