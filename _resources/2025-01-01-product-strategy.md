# Product Strategy

Product Strategy questions can be categorised into 3 main buckets:

- Define a company strategy
- Expand to new markets (new products, new use cases of existing products, expanding into new customer segments with an existing use case)
- Building a business on top of a new technology

## How to solve?

- Come up with a genuine answer as if you were in the leadership of this company
- Read about the strategies of different businesses by reading recent keynotes from the leadership and develop your own perspective on these strategies
- Always consider tradeoffs

## Broad framework:

- Clarifying questions to scope the problem effectively, state assumptions clearly and confirm
    - clarify keywords form the question
    - timeframe / resource constraints
- Competition: What are their products? What features are different from ours? Where they might be better than us in solving customer problems? Where they might be weak.
- Broader market: consumer trends, macro environment, forces impact supply-chain etc. Apply Porter 5 forces (suppliers, buyers, new entrants, substitutes)
- Our own business
    - Product / Placement (distribution channels)/ Pricing
    - Strengths, weakness
    - Current strategy
    - Products on the roadmap
- Tradeoffs

### Define a 10-year strategy for Uber?

**Mission**: Set an ambitious vision: Move things (not just people)

**Customer tenets** 

- Fast and convenient
- Safe
- Economic conscious

**Porter 5 forces:**

1. **Competition** 
    - Obvious: Lyft
    - Non-obvious competition: (self-driving) Cruise, Google etc. What are the strategic moats for these companies?
2. **Customers** 
    1. Network effects: more customers the platform has means the focus should be on a mass consumer offering 
    2. Internationalise: go into local markets to compete which has 2 usecases
        1. Transporting things from point A to point B (point B could be an international location which would make the value prop stronger) 
        2. People travelling to international locations 
3. **Suppliers**
    1. Gig economy: Drivers are not controlled by Uber. 
    2. Start owning the supply chain. How do you either build your own fleet or invest in autonomous driving?  
4. **Substitutes**
    1. Other modes of transportation (public taxis - low)
    2. Moving things (UPS, Amazon, DHL)is a commodity business - affordable price 
5. **New entrants** 
    1. Hyperloop
    2. Decentralised transportation networks similar to DeFi

## Go To Market Launch

- Promotion (trials, POC, deals)

### 4Ps for Google

1. Products 
    1. Software
        1. OS

        3. Desktop apps 
        4. Web apps 
    2. Hardware
    3. Services 
2. Placement / Distribution 
    1. Online: The company uses its websites, apps, and platforms as distribution mechanisms to reach target users/customers. 
    2. Offline: For goods like Pixel smartphones, Google uses vendors or retailers as the main outlets.
3. Promotion
    1. Sales promotions: discounts and free product usage. For example, the company allows free use of Gmail. Coupons are also given to potential advertisers to try using Google Ads for free within certain limits.
    2. Advertising: Different media types like newspapers, google news. 
    3. Public relations: financial and technical support for communities. This support promotes the technology business by creating a positive brand image.  
    4. Sponsorship: sponsorship for various events, such as social outreach programs.
    5. Direct marketing: Google’s online advertising of its own products is a direct approach to reach customers. For instance, the company advertises its Google Ads service via Gmail, such that the advertisements are shown to users who have a history of searching for digital advertising solutions. Thus, the business directly promotes its products to individual customers based on personal usage data, such as device location and search history. In this case, the granularity and specificity of showing personalized or semi-personalized ads to online users can be considered as a form of direct marketing. 
4. Pricing and Pricing strategies  
    1. Freemium pricing: Gmail free for consumers but paid for business
    2. Market-oriented pricing: Pixel and cromecast
    3. Penetration pricing: Google cloud platform
    4. Value-based pricing: Ads
