# Tips and frameworks for interviews

1. **Passive and active checkins** - have a right mix.  Get this in every 2-3 mins but don't overdo. 
    1. Passive - I am now going to move on point-2 unless you have anything else you have to add or you want to redirect me? I'll move on point-2 
    2. Active - I have just spoken about this and I am going to cover xyz in my next part. Does that sound ok?
2. **Triangle method** - Have a structure and outline it in the beginning. Have 3 points. 
3. **Always mention tradeoffs / risks** and how you would mitigate them. This emphasises that you are thinking holistically**.** Example: While building a feature that collects a lot of user data, talk about how you would respect the data privacy of users and how you would lay a great emphasis on ensuring security and that it's not traded to other companies. Maybe to mitigate risk you'll have a standby statement from the PR team.  
4. **Broad then deep** - tweak the framework according to the question. Example - What google product will be most successful in 10 years?
    1. **Mention valuable candidates** 
        - Youtube
        - Android
        - Photos
        - News
        - Search
    2. **Give context** - Talk more about the growth potential of each individually
    3. **Pick and articulate why** - Radically successful will be xyz in my opinion and Why? Based on competition - search is dominant and is google backbone. No current formidable competition for search. 
5. Have a narrative and walk the interviewer through it 
6. If you are stuck - 
    1. Breathe 
    2. Be honest and ask for specific guidance - I am thinking about xyz in this direction. Do you think this looks good to proceed with?

**Keep in mind for all interviews   -**

- Address the interviewer by their first name in certain cases (can be used to get back attention and creates a personal connection)
    - Let me know if that sounds ok, Mark?
- Always give anecdotes from your life to backup certain claims. This also puts you in the user shoes first hand.
- Try to create a personal connection with the interviewer by asking questions about themselves as well while they give an introduction or later post the interview
- Don’t be dull! Be happy and keep it light.

**Basic things to take care of and structure to follow for all type of PM questions:**

1. Take time and think first once the question is asked
2. Underline the keywords in the question
3. Ask clarifications on the underlined keywords
4. Create a high-level structure/tree based on the framework that you intend to use
5. Go broad and then go deep
6. Your details should showcase that you’re thinking of every possible scenario even though it might seem minor
