## Charisma Demystified

- Becoming more charismatic involves simple tweaks to your behavior.
• Charisma doesn't require you to be outgoing or attractive, or for you to change your personality.
• It's a skill, a discipline, like playing a sport or an instrument.
• It takes work, practice, and the right set of tools.

## The Charismatic Behaviors: Presence, Power, and Warmth

- Increasing your charisma involves behaviors that project more of three core charismatic qualities: presence, power, and warmth.
• All three are communicated mostly through body language, which isn't under your conscious control.
• Instead, your internal (emotional and mental) state determines your body language.
• By choosing what you imagine, and by learning how to adjust your mental state, you can ensure that body language projects more presence, power, and warmth, and thus charisma.
• In terms of achieving charisma, your internal state is critical. Get the internal state right, and the right charismatic behaviors and body language will pour forth automatically.
• Being present—paying attention to what's going on rather than being caught up in your thoughts—can yield immense rewards.
• When you exhibit presence, those around you feel listened to, respected, and valued.

## The Obstacles to Presence, Power, and Warmth

- Discomfort affects your mental state and prevents you from projecting presence, power, and warmth.
• It impacts how you feel, how you perform, and how others perceive you.
• This applies to both physical discomfort and mental discomfort, such as anxiety, dissatisfaction, self-criticism, and self-doubt.
• Aim to prevent discomfort by planning ahead to ensure comfort in clothing, location, and timing.
• If discomfort arises, you can either address it (for instance, with a mental technique such as the responsibility transfer) or explain it so that it's not misperceived.
• In all cases, being aware of the discomfort is the first step in being able to address it.

## Overcoming the Obstacles

- There is a simple three-step process for addressing internal discomfort so that your charisma can shine through.
• First, destigmatize it by recognizing that we all experience the same kinds of internal discomfort, that they're completely normal and nothing to be ashamed of.
• Think of others who've gone through this before—especially people you admire—and see yourself as part of a community of human beings experiencing the same feeling at the same moment.
• Second, neutralize the negativity attached to the experience by reminding yourself that the negative thoughts are not necessarily accurate.
• Third, rewrite reality by designing and adopting an interpretation of the situation that gives you a more charismatic state.

## Creating Charismatic Mental States

- Once you've addressed the obstacles, the next step is to consciously create mental states that help you project charisma.
• Visualization, used commonly by professional athletes, is a remarkably versatile and powerful tool for accessing the right mental state.
• Practicing gratitude, goodwill, and compassion puts you in a mental state that projects warmth.
• And compassion for yourself, surprisingly, helps you access all aspects of charisma.
• You can also use those elements of body language you do control, such as posture and facial expressions, to impact your mental state, which then feeds back into the rest of your body language, initiating a positive cycle.
• Just as professional athletes and performers do, plan a gradual warm-up to your peak charismatic performance.
• Before important events, avoid experiences that would impair your warmth and plan confidence-boosting activities instead.

## Different Charisma Styles

- Different styles of charisma are appropriate for different people and different situations.
• We look at four that are both practical and accessible.
• Focus charisma is achieved primarily through presence and good listening, and makes people feel heard, understood, and respected.
• Visionary charisma requires a bold vision that is delivered with complete conviction; it inspires people to believe in and want to be a part of this vision.
• Kindness charisma primarily involves warmth and acceptance, and creates an emotional connection.
• Authority charisma is achieved primarily through the projection of power and status, and leads people to listen or obey.
• You can alternate among different charisma styles or even blend them together.
• To decide which charisma style to use, consider your personality, your goals, and the specific situation at hand.

## Charismatic First Impressions

- First impressions matter.
• Within minutes or even seconds, people form an impression of your status, your personality, and much else about you, and this evaluation filters their future perceptions of you.
• The first impression you make starts with your appearance, and typically continues with your handshake and the start of your conversation.
• People feel most comfortable with those who are similar to them in some way, including appearance and behavior.
• Good first impressions can weigh heavily in your favor, just as bad ones can take significant work to undo.
• Great conversationalists keep the spotlight on the other person and make them feel good about themselves, because people will associate you with whatever feelings you produce in them.

**Graceful Conversation exits** 

- Offer something of value when ending interactions:
    - Information: recommend an article, book, or website relevant to their interests
    - Connections: introduce them to someone they should meet
    - Visibility: invite them to speak at an organization you belong to
    - Recognition: suggest an award they might be nominated for

## Speaking—and Listening—with Charisma

- There are specific verbal and vocal techniques for projecting each of the three elements of charisma.
• Presence is communicated by listening well, not interrupting, and pausing before you speak.
• Warmth is projected by creating positive associations, avoiding negative associations, and making other people feel valued and important.
• Power is projected when you speak concisely, using metaphors and providing high value.
• The pitch, tone, and tempo of your speech are as important as what you say in determining what you project.

## Charismatic Body Language

- Your verbal communication—what you say—primarily reaches people's logical side.
• Your nonverbal communication—how you say it—primarily reaches people's emotional side.
• Nonverbal communication creates stronger reactions and moves people to action.
• Through emotional contagion, your emotions can spread to other people.
• Nonverbal warmth can be projected by managing physical and personal space to make the other person feel comfortable, by mirroring their body language, and by making the right kind of eye contact.
• Nonverbal power can be projected by using "big gorilla" body language and avoiding unnecessary movements.

## Difficult Situations

- Difficult situations may challenge your charisma skills, but they also present opportunities.
• Charismatically handling a difficult situation can make the difference between making an enemy and making a friend.
• Preparation and approach are important: choose the timing and location to maximize their comfort and your charisma, and be prepared with ways to be both appreciative and empathetic.
• When you need to win someone over, asking them for their opinion and expressing gratitude for things they've done for you in the past are ways to encourage them to rationalize in your favor.
• When delivering positive information, make it specific and personal; when delivering negative information, make it specific but depersonalize it.
• All of the charisma tools you've learned are useful here, especially the ones to manage your own internal state.

## Presenting with Charisma

- Public speaking can have a major influence on how you are perceived.
• Craft your message clearly and simply, use vivid stories, metaphors, and analogies, and focus on things the audience can relate to.
• Make your presentation short and entertaining. Watch the value of each sentence.
• Choose your clothing to create a specific image and feeling, but also to be comfortable.
• Practice extensively (including in front of real audiences), and weed out unnecessary sounds and motions.
• During the speech itself, put your focus on your audience rather than on yourself, and don't forget to pause and breathe.
• Use body language and intonation to express the types of power and warmth you want to project.
• Limit superfluous gestures that distract the audience's attention.
• Pause frequently and deliberately to show confidence and add drama as well as to give yourself a chance to breathe.

## Charisma in a Crisis

- In times of crisis, charismatic leadership is especially important.
• Others are often more open to charismatic leadership, but they are also more sensitive to the mood and emotions of the leader.
• Retain equanimity, regularly check your physiology, and use the tools for managing your mental state.
• Express high expectations and articulate a vision that both addresses the crisis and has relevance beyond it.
• Articulate a bold vision, show your confidence in your ability to realize that vision, and act decisively to achieve it.

## The Charismatic Life: Rising to the Challenge

- Charisma changes the way people relate to you, and challenges come along with the benefits.
• You become more of a magnet for praise, but also for envy, and you may be held to higher standards than others.
• At the highest levels, being charismatic may set you apart enough for it to be a lonely experience.
• Sharing credit, expressing praise for others, and showing vulnerability can help mitigate these possible side effects.
• People may also feel more comfortable with you in the moment, and open up in ways they regret or feel ashamed of later.
• Charisma can also be powerful in the wrong ways.
• People may want to follow you even when you're wrong, rely on you too much, or take unjustified risks because of their faith in your ability to fix anything.
• Charisma is a powerful tool that you need to use responsibly.

## Increase the amount of power you want to convey

- Close your eyes and relax.
- Remember a past experience when you felt absolutely triumphant (e.g., winning a contest or award).
- Engage all your senses in the memory:
    - Hear the sounds: murmurs of approval, applause
    - See people's smiles and expressions of warmth and admiration
    - Feel physical sensations: your feet on the ground, congratulatory handshakes
    - Experience the warm glow of confidence rising within you

## Before Presentations

- Even 30 seconds of visualization can make a substantial difference to your performance.
- Arrive at the venue early to walk around the stage and get comfortable with the space.
- Bring uplifting, energizing music to help set the right mental state.
- Create mental movies while on stage:
    - Vividly imagine how well the speech will go
    - Visualize the audience's enthusiastic response
    - See yourself confidently moving across the stage
- Link confident, triumphant feelings to that particular environment.
- Use visualization even when you know your speech extremely well.

# Exercises

**Getting Satisfaction**

• Think of someone who has aggrieved you.
• Take a blank page and write them a letter saying everything you wish you had ever told them. Make sure you write it out by hand.
• When you've gotten absolutely everything off your mind, put the letter aside.
• Now write their answer, apologizing for everything they've done and taking responsibility for all their hurtful actions.
• For maximum effect, reread their apology a few times over the course of a week.

**Delving into Sensations**

To practice your endurance in uncomfortable situations, find a quiet, comfortable spot to sit with a partner, and set a timer for thirty seconds.

• Look into your partner's eyes. As soon as you become aware of discomfort, notice where the feelings are located in your body.
• Delve into each sensation as much as you can; feel its texture. Describe each as if you were a chef describing a featured dish.
• Let the discomfort build. Observe and name the sensations you feel: hot, cold, tightness in your jaw, a knot in your stomach.
• Resist the urge to laugh, talk, or relieve the discomfort.
• Try the same practice again, this time giving yourself continuous encouragement. Remind yourself that your efforts will reap rewards and that the discomfort will pass.

**Warmth**

Close your eyes and relax. Employ your senses as you focus on a moment in your life when you felt triumphant:

• Hear the sounds in the room: the murmurs of approval, the swell of applause.
• See people's smiles and expressions of warmth and admiration.
• Feel your feet on the ground and the congratulatory handshakes.
• Above all, experience your feelings, the warm glow of confidence rising within you.

Gratitude

For quick gratitude access, find three things you can approve of right now. Scan your body and your environment for little, tangible things you could be grateful for.

Compassion

Follow the three steps below to practice compassion for someone: Imagine their past. What was it like growing up in their family and experiencing their childhood?Imagine their present. Put yourself in their place. See through their eyes. Imagine what they might be feeling right now.Imagine delivering their eulogy.

Self-Compassion

Keep a self-compassion list. Jot down five ways that you already care for yourself when you're having a hard time. If you're on a roll, go for ten. Star those

Metta (kindness/goodwill)

The visualization below will guide you through Metta step by step. 

- Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take two or three deep breaths, letting them wash away your worries.
- Think of a time in your life when you performed a good deed, whether big or small. Now imagine a being—it could be someone from the present or past, real or mythical, a person, pet, or even a cherished stuffed animal—whom you can picture having warm affection for you.
- Picture this being in your mind and feel their warmth, kindness, and compassion. Let their affection surround you. Feel them offering complete forgiveness for everything your inner critic claims isn't good enough about you or your life.
- Experience their total acceptance of you exactly as you are now, with all your imperfections, at this stage of your journey.

## Practising Charisma Styles

- Choose low-stakes situations to expand your comfort zone:
    - Networking events with little career impact
    - Cocktail parties with minimal social consequences
    - Brief interactions with service personnel (cashiers, doormen)
- Use these occasions to experiment with new charisma behaviors.
- For high-stakes situations (key presentations, job interviews), stick with behaviors and charisma styles most natural to you.
- Avoid risking coming across as uncomfortable or inauthentic when it matters most.
